Especially Cider and Cursive are so great, and for libraries, there are a lot of solid ones like Ring/Compojure, interesting things like Duct, Pathom, Fulcro.)

Still just a novice, but I read the racket documentation and did Advent of Code one year using just Racket. Advent of Code was a pretty nice as you had to do some odd things for some of the exercises.
The reason to learn Scheme is because it's the easiest way to learn Lisp. There's a ton of good material available. As for being able to do something, Chicken is impressive. There are a lot of libraries. It's easy to call existing C libraries, and easy to call from C. It's not as though it's a choice of Scheme vs. Common Lisp vs. Clojure. It can be all three, and once you know one, it's easy to pick up the others.
TL;DR: Scheme's market is those who want the easiest route to learn Lisp.

----
You could build a command-line app. Start small, build a binary, then parse CLI args (clingon or adopt libraries, see Cookbook).

You could build a wrapper to a web API, build a Telegram bot (quite easy, see awesome-cl links).

You could build a simple web page, giving the status of something. A todo app: https://github.com/KikyTokamuro/todolist-cl

You could use these apps of mine: https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents - https://gitlab.com/vindarel/abstock/ (show products online) - https://github.com/vindarel/cl-bookshops, use and extend a music player: https://github.com/ahefner/shuffletron search lyrics: https://github.com/vindarel/lyrics-cli/

or use the Lem editor and add something it's missing.

----
One thing I enjoy doing when I explore a new programming language is solving programming exercises like those in Advent of Code or similar. They have in my opinion several advantages:

- The problem is small and the problem statement is usually easy to understand. Small means "it fits in the head", so that you can concentrate on the language aspects

- Solving the problem requires to use fundamental features of the programming language: flow control, data structures, data manipulation I/O, ‚Ä¶- (This is true for AOC, but I believe it applies to other sources of problems)

- There's a rich community and you can examine the solutions of other people. When done **after** working on your own solution I find this particularly useful to learn idioms and techniques specific to the language

- If you get stuck or bored, you can always switch to the next problem

-----
This is just an opinion, but I think Lisps and Schemes (by which I include Clojure and Racket) are areas where it really helps if you learn the language *properly*, rather than just building things and thus reverting to old habit with just more parens... ;-)
-----
If you have any other programming experience like C, C++, python, etc, you need to let them go and free yourself from their constraints.

After that, find a book. All the ones recommended here are good.
----
First and foremost, is try to approach it as if you are just learning programming as a beginner.
Something I didn't realize I was even really doing, was looking at Lisp from my C/C++ experience and trying to force fit it into my existing mental programming model. It will feel like you are running uphill and will truly impede understanding the underlying conceptual and structural paradigms of Lisp. Understanding Lisp isn't hard, but it can feel foreign. I had to make several runs at it myself until I saw past the clouds, so to speak. Now, I no longer want to program in any other language than Common Lisp or, in some cases, Scheme.

As others have mentioned, the book Practical Common Lisp is good. Personally, I had more success with Scheme at first (since it is a Lisp 1 and in a way can feel more pure) , however, I have moved into Common Lisp and Emacs.

Potentially controversial, but, I would recommend not trying to get started on Lisp from within Emacs, unless you are already know Emacs and can maneuver in it. Otherwise, it will get in your way of learning Lisp because the control commands are all different. However, that said, once you do learn enough Lisp, learn Emacs. You'll appreciate it's power and what it brings to the table more immediately and that will help you get over learning the different command codes. I think the combo of learning Lisp + learning Emacs can be too much at once for someone coming from the mainland... Instead use whatever editor you want, just having parenthesis matching is all you really need at first, and if you can spin up a REPL in it even better. Atom has this ability and is friendly enough and I use it from time to time.

Anyway, this has been my experience at least.
-----
There are many free Racket/Scheme resources, but only a few are suitable for "...no prior coding experience" [2]

SICP, often referenced in the context of this sort of question, is a classic CS text using Scheme, but not an introduction to Scheme or a descendant like Racket. [3]

...currently covering Lambdas and I feel very lost...

Lambda forms are an important Computer Science concept, best studied after learning practical usage in Scheme or Racket.

Racket provides "Student Languages" for learning to code. After learning BSL (Beginning Student language), one can proceed to "Intermediate Student with Lambda" with its "higher-order function" forms, where lambda is idiomatic code:

(filter (lambda (x) (integer? x)) '(1 1.5 2 3.0 4/5))
=> (list 1 2 3)
Racket's integrated documentation is excellent: in DrRacket, right-click (control-click) on any name (eg "filter" above) and choose "Search in Help Desk..." from the pop-up menu to see definition and examples

[1] (assuming this means "Racket/ComputerScience", not Racket/ChezScheme :)

[2] "This course is primarily targeted at students who have never programmed before" (from the overview for the first module of the course)

[3] "In teaching our material we use a dialect of the programming language Lisp. We never formally teach the language, because we don't have to." [SICP preface]
